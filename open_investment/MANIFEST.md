# Open Finance for All: Your Money, Your Rules

## The problem

Today, most people who want to invest must hand over their money and control to a third party.

Due to lack of financial education, understanding, and transparency, several questions arise when a third party controls or holds our money:
- Security: Could my money be transferred to another third party with or without the consent of the first party?
- Privacy: Could my information (identity, amount of money, etc.) be shared with another third party with or without the consent of the first party?
- Goal: Is it really this party's objective to grow MY money? What is their interest and at what cost?

Many other questions arise from this observation, but I will focus only on these.

## My vision

**[DRAFT]**

I envision a world where a solution exists that enables every person, regardless of their financial knowledge or technical expertise, to manage and invest their money while maintaining complete control over their assets.

## My principles

**[DRAFT]**

### Transparency

Transparency is the foundation of trust in any financial system. When you cannot verify what happens to your money or how decisions are made, you must rely on blind faith in third parties.

To address this, the solution must be:
- **Verifiable**: Every transaction, decision, and operation must be traceable and verifiable by the user, without requiring trust in a third party's word.

### Freedom

Financial freedom means having true control over your assets and the ability to operate independently of intermediaries.

### Accessibility

Financial tools should not be reserved for the technically savvy or financially educated. True financial freedom requires that everyone can participate, regardless of their background.

This means:
- **Ease of use**: The interface and user experience must be intuitive and straightforward, hiding complexity while maintaining transparency and control.
- **Education**: Providing clear, accessible resources to help users understand how to use the tools safely and effectively, empowering them to make informed decisions.

## Solutions

**[DRAFT]**

- **Open source**: The code, algorithms, and logic behind the system must be publicly available for anyone to inspect, audit, and understand.

- **Self-hosting**: You should be able to run the system on your own infrastructure, without depending on external services that could be shut down, censored, or compromised.
- **Self-custody**: Your assets should remain under your direct control, stored in wallets and accounts that you own and manage, not held by custodians.
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Leveraging decentralized currencies and blockchain technology enables true ownership and removes the need for traditional financial intermediaries.
